## Updating Locales

Contents of `.po` files are populated by `/scripts/update-locales.sh po`. These strings are gathered from `.py` and `.kv` files in `/src/network_puzzles/gui/`.
Translations into `fr` are made manually in `fr.po`.
Binary `.mo` files are updated by `/scripts/update-locales.sh mo`.
